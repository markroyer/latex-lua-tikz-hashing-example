# latex-lua-tikz-hashing-example

A latex example using lua and tikz to create hash table diagrams.

The `hashing.tex` file contains examples diagrams of drawing hash tables using lua and tikz.


## Setup

Make sure that you have the Debian `texlive` package installed.

For debian and/or emacs users, I find that for it's useful to have the `lua-mode`
package installed for editing lua files.

## Usage

You can build the PDF document by typing

```
make
```

in the root of the repository. The file `hashing.pdf` is the
generated output.

Typing

```
make clean
```

will remove all generated files.
